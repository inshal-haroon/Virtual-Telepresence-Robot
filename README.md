--------- Description ---------

This is an IoT-based robot controlled through Arduino and Raspberry Pi technology. This robot could provide live video feed to the user through Virtual Reality Headset while sitting at a different place giving the sense of virtual presence instead of physically being there. Moreover, the camera placed on the robot could be moved in the direction of the user’s head movement in real-time using a VR Headset. Hence, allowing the users to not only control the robot’s movement wirelessly but also control the camera in any direction just by moving their head or looking in the desired direction.   <br>
